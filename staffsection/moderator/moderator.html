The playerbase we work with on Realm of Lothiredon is a great start for new moderators seeing as most players are very mature and know how to obey the rules. Other than that, the staff is very friendly and helpful who will help you with any problems you encounter."</p>

My fellow staff members as well as the regular players have created a great community here, with smooth communication between each and every one of us. There has not been a moment that I've felt uncomfortable on the server and I've had the pleasure to help other players find their way just like the staff did when I first joined. The current staff team is mature and constantly growing and innovative. The worlds and mini-games are also wonderful, with massive plots and a smart ranking system in Creative and a limitless world in Survival, with build protection."</p>
