We are looking for developers who are skilled enough to code a complete game within Minecraft and are yet able to work in a team. Of course we offer training as well by starting with smaller and simpler projects for the developers who may not be as skilled as the lead developers. Do you think you can assist us in coding the framework behind the entire game? Apply down below! </span></p>
